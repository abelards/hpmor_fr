As per the author's own words: http://hpmor.com/info/

> All fanfiction involves borrowing the original author’s characters,
> situations, and world. It is ridiculous to turn around and complain
> if your own ideas get borrowed in turn.
> Anyone is welcome to steal anything from any fanfiction I write.
